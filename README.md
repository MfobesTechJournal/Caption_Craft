# Social Media Caption Generator

## Project Goal
The primary objective of Caption Craft is to deliver a deployed, functional AI-powered web application that solves the common challenge of writing engaging social media content.

The system is designed to:

Generate Platform-Specific Captions: Produce three distinct caption options tailored for different social platforms: Instagram (focus on engagement/hashtags), Twitter/X (focus on brevity/trending topics), and LinkedIn (focus on professional tone/networking).

Ensure Contextual Relevance: Utilize the "Write a relevant prompt" feature (Constraints field) to encourage users to insert brief, precise descriptions. This helps the underlying AI model (Gemini) understand the exact context, tone, and constraints (e.g., "Use 3 emojis," "Keep it under 150 characters") of their request, ensuring high-quality, targeted output.

Provide an Intuitive and Appealing UI: Implement a clean, modern user interface with an energetic color palette (appealing to Millennial and Gen Z users) while maintaining high legibility and intuitive structure (appealing to Gen X and older users).

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash), Vercel, Git & GitHub
