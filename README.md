# Social Media Caption Generator

## Project Goal
Deliver a deployed, functional AI app that generates three distinct social media captions (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn) based on user input, and includes the "Write relevant prompt" bonus feature. Users are encouraged to insert a brief description text for the system to know the exact context of their prompt or request.

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash).
